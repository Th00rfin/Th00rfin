## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm John Michael Dacara, a passionate web developer from Manila, Philippines. Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸš€


## About Me
- I'm John Michael Dacara, 20 years old, and I'm currently studying at Manuel A. Roxas High School. As a Grade 12 student, I have a hobby of coding. I started coding in Grade 9, but I took it seriously when I was in Grade 10. I'm happy that I've been able to learn and pursue web development, especially full-stack development. Also I have been in cybersecurity- penetration testing. I learned 3 months of the fundamentals of cybersecurity, how complex is the technology and how you will secure your users.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fullstack dev with use of react js
- ðŸ’¡ I love exploring new technologies and building cool projects.
